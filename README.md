## Personal Learnings

In the making of this project, I have began to learn the following:

- Sass/Scss
- Web accessibility 
- jQuery
- Ajax
- APIs
- CSS grid
- CSS animation
- Web performance


This project helped me build on my JavaScript and CSS skills and also helped me learn how to make my websites more accessible to everyone and perform better. I am beginning to feel a bit more confident in my developer skills and I am eager to continue to learn and practice. JavaScript remains the area I need to work the most on.
